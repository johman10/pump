# Pump

Heavily inspired on [Matthew Rayfield's idea](https://twitter.com/MatthewRayfield/status/1169599725731024901), check out his [Github repo](https://github.com/MatthewRayfield/popup-pump) too! He has a way easier approach to it all, but I wanted to give it a go with ServiceWorker messages instead to challenge myself, and why not!?

This contains some extra features compared to Matthew's work. The hose will know where the balloon is, the balloon also explodes when it becomes either horizontal or vertically full.

Hope you like it! :D

P.S. Please don't take this too serious. The code isn't very well structured and could definitely use some work to make it easier/faster, it was just an expirement for me.
